## Maze Solver

Welcome to Maze Solver, an exciting project that emerged from my very first year in computer engineering. This maze game project challenged my problem-solving skills and offered an opportunity for creative exploration.

## Gameplay Overview:
Maze Solver is an automated adventure that immerses players in the captivating world of mazes. As the game unfolds, it offers two enticing options:

* Create a New Maze (Press Y):
Embark on a journey as a maze creator and craft your unique labyrinth. These designs are meticulously stored in an external file, ensuring that you can revisit and explore them whenever you like.

* Solve the Current Maze (Press C):
Maze Solver takes the reins, employing a powerful recursive algorithm to navigate and conquer mazes. Beware, though, as three hidden bombs lie in wait. If you stumble upon a bomb, brace yourself for a thunderous "boom" sound and a message proclaiming, "Maze Not Solved." Should you triumph over the maze, you'll be rewarded with the triumphant message, "Maze Solved."

## Exploration and Creativity:
After the maze adventure, players have the option to further engage with their creations:

* Draw the Original Maze (Press L):
Witness your artistic prowess as you gaze upon the intricate original maze.

* Draw the Coordinates of the Bombs (Press B):
Uncover the precise locations of those treacherous bombs.

* Draw the Game's Path Coordinates (Press X):
Reveal the path you took to conquer the maze, displaying the intricate route you followed.

* Exit the Game (Press Esc):
Conclude your adventure and receive the final outcome of your journey.
